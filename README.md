# AbcQuran

## A quran app
AbcQuran is a 100% free, open-source software available on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It allows one to stream high-quality quranic recitations and read suras in hundreds of translations, including a Madani mushaf. It is meant for students as well as for regular readers, muslim and non-muslim.

# Which technology does it use ?
AbcQuran uses the Flutter framework with a Riverpod MVVM-like architecture.

## Contribute
I believe this project can get big if we work together. Why not contribute and make the quran widely available ?<br>
